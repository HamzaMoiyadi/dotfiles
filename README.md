# Personal DotFiles Repo


## Requirements

1. [ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH#install-and-set-up-zsh-as-default)
2. [Starship](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation) 
3. Any Nerd Font. [Preference is Fira Code (till now at least)](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.2/FiraCode.zip)

## File List

### Shell Stuff

- `.zshrc`: File that is sourced the first time shell is opened. 
- `.zshenv`: List of environment variables that will be used in the ZSH shell
- `.config/zsh`: Contains `.zsh` files for `aliases` and `functions`
- `starship.toml`: Shell Prompt configuration. 
- `windows-terminal-settings.jsonc`: Stripped down `.json` file containing settings for Windows Terminal

### TODO

[ ] Create private gists for the installation scripts, as keeping them in the `dotfiles` repo does not make sense thematically.
[ ] Clean-up `windows-terminal-settings.jsonc`.
